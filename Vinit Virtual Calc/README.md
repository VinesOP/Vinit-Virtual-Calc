Vinit Virtual Calculator
Vinit Virtual Calculator is a hand gesture-controlled calculator built using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. This calculator allows users to perform mathematical operations by recognizing hand gestures in real-time through a webcam. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, factorials, exponentials, derivatives, and more.

Features
Hand gesture recognition: The calculator interprets hand gestures to input mathematical expressions.
Advanced functions: Supports a variety of mathematical functions, including trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, and derivatives.
Error handling: Provides feedback for invalid inputs and ensures a smooth user experience.
Intuitive interface: Buttons for each mathematical operation are displayed on the screen, and users can interact with the calculator using hand gestures.
Usage
Run the Handtm.py file to initialize the hand gesture detection.
Launch the virtual calculator using the vinit virtual calculator.py file.
Interact with the calculator by showing hand gestures corresponding to different buttons on the screen.
Perform mathematical operations seamlessly with the power of hand gestures.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Mediapipe
